# 📋 Personal Task Tracker

Hi! This is a simple task tracker web app I built using React as part of an internship assignment.

It helps you log your daily tasks, mark them as complete/incomplete, and filter them based on status.  
I’ve used localStorage to keep all data saved even after you close the browser.

## 🔧 Features

- Login with just your name (stored in localStorage)
- Add a task with title and optional description
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- Delete tasks when done
- Filter tasks by: All / Completed / Pending
- Simple and clean UI

---

## 💻 Tech Used

- React (Functional Components + Hooks)
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- localStorage (no backend used)

## 📌 Notes
This project was created as part of a frontend assignment for an internship.
I kept the design simple, clean, and fully functional — all data is stored in the browser.
